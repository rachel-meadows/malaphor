# MALAPHOR GENERATOR

_A malaphor (mixed metaphor) generator to mint new idioms._

## What is a malaphor?
A malaphor is an error in which **two figures of speech are merged**, producing an often nonsensical result.

For example, we can take the idioms "It's not brain science" and "It's not rocket surgery" and recombine them to create the common malaphor, "It's not rocket surgery."

A less common malaphor example would be "We'll burn that bridge when we get to it" (from _"Burn one's bridges"_ and _"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it"_). 

## Why a malaphor generator?
At the time of writing this, there is no malaphor generator that works on any corpus of data. As a result, the only work in this space uses a small handful of 5-10 predefined idioms to generate semi-random recombinations.

This generator scrapes Wiktionary's corpus of 8000+ idioms, which is constantly being updated. The scope of this allows for more possible malaphors to be evaluated, and for rudimentary criteria to be used to 'grade' them before showing the best ones to the user.

These malaphors are entirely novel, which makes them fun - every new generation is a roll of the dice!

_And on that topic - please note that as some of the idioms in Wiktionary's corpus contain profanity, so too can the malaphors generated by this program_
